# Computational Intelligence 2021-2022

Exam of computational intelligence 2021 - 2022. It requires teaching the client to play the game of Hanabi (rules can be found [here](https://www.spillehulen.dk/media/102616/hanabi-card-game-rules.pdf)).

Team:

## Agent
It's sufficient to call the agent.sh script with a string as a name for the agent during the game.
Caveat: the code imports a variable called `SEED` from constants.py that we added for debugging purpose.
